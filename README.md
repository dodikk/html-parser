# Block-based Cocoa HTML Parser

This is a simple wrapper around the excellent [DTHTMLParser][1] which is 
a bit easier to use by utilizing blocks. I retained its original license,
because my work is miniscule. Just drop the four files in your project,
add $(SDKROOT)/usr/include/libxml2, link to libxml2 and go - but don't
forget to attribute.
